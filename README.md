Recognise emotions in images with Emotion API:

The Emotion API takes a facial expression in an image as an input, and returns the confidence across a set of emotions for each face in the image, as well as bounding box for the face, using the Face API. If a user has already called the Face API, they can submit the face rectangle as an optional input.
The emotions detected are anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness and surprise. These emotions are understood to be communicated universally across cultures with particular facial expressions.
